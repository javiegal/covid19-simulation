# covid19-simulation

## Description

Project developed for the Data Processes course of the Master's Programme in Data Science of UPM.

This repository contains all the work done for the Data Processes assignment described in the [assignment guide](./docs/assignment_guide.pdf).

## Deliverables
- [Project plan](./docs/project_plan.pdf).
- [Technical report](./docs/technical_report.pdf).
- [Python script](./__main__.py) with the data analysis.
- [KNIME package]() with the prediction model.

## Requirements
The data analysis has been developed using the following software:
- Python 3.8.10
- Pandas 1.3.3
- Scikit-learn 1.0
- matplotlib 3.4.3
- Seaborn 0.11.2
- Lifelines 0.26.4

Prediction models have been developed using the following software:
- KNIME 4.5.0


## Usage
To reproduce the data analysis performed, extract the content of the zip file in a folder and execute the following command:
```
$ python FOLDER_PATH
```
This execution will produce the console output, images (in `covid19-simulation/imgs` folder) and processed data (in `covid19-simulation/data` folder) explained in the [technical report](./docs/technical_report.pdf).
